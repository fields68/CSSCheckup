                Usagi Tsukino is the Sailor Guardian of love and justice, Sailor Moon. Originally from a prosperous civilization on the Moon known as the Moon Kingdom, she was reborn on Earth and re-awoke as the leader of the Sailor Senshi.

                In the beginning, Usagi is seen to be a cheerful, immature girl. She cries easily and is often overtaken with emotion. She also displays an unwavering hope and sees good in her enemies that others may not. Usagi has a pure heart and is always there for everyone. She can be jealous at times, especially over Mamoru, but overall is a kind, strong, courageous girl. She stands up for what is right and believes everyone deserves love.

                When Usagi became Eternal Sailor Moon, her uniform underwent the most radical changes; she no longer wears a tiara and instead has a golden crescent moon on her forehead, her leotard no longer has chest armor, her earrings have a golden star attached beneath each crescent moon, and her choker is red and v-shaped with a pink heart at the center and a golden crescent moon beneath it. The collar itself is like her original one, but it is a darker shade of blue with three golden stripes. In the place of her shoulder pads are pink bubble-like sleeves with two red fittings at the ends; they have somewhat of a translucent aspect to them. In the area where her chest bow was located is a pair of white angel wings with a pink heart that has a golden crescent moon attached to it sitting at its center. Her gloves now have red, v-shaped wristbands with golden crescent moons on them, the fittings at the ends of the gloves have feather barrettes attached to them similar to the ones in her hair, and the gloves themselves are now extended to reach up to her upper arms. Her belt is now comprised of two ribbons (the one on top is yellow and the one beneath it is red) clipped together by a golden crescent moon; the bottom ribbon extends past her skirt, mimicking the flowing effect that her previous back bow had. Her back bow is replaced with a set of large white angel wings, her skirt is now composed of three layers (the top layer is yellow, the middle layer is red, the bottom layer is blue), and her boots are now white and knee-length with a slightly larger heel and red v-shaped borders that have golden crescent moons on them.
